Hi! I am Ajeeta. I am a software engineer at Bloomberg, NYC. I love interacting with financial clients and building software that serves their use-case. It thrills me to be able to deliver high impact business value!

Apart from work I enjoy reading, favorite ones include Gone Girl, A House for Mr. Biswas, Truck de, India!, Shoe Dog. 
I also enjoy being active in running communities and watching basketball matches in NYC. I have been trying to work on my cooking skills.
